Game for Spring 2018 Web Server Programming Course

I am Dean Corn, a student in the Graduate Computer Science program at SUNY New Paltz, and holder of a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics/Computer Science from St. Joseph's College.
During my time at SUNY New Paltz I have taken Algorithms, Operating Systems, Data Analytics, and a Foundations of Data Science course. 
During my undergraduate studies I took quite a few courses including Computer Communications and Networking, Database Systems, and Computer Graphics.
For languages I have experience in Java, C++, and R.
For IDE I am experienced with working in Visual Studio, Eclipse, and R Studio.

My goal for this course is to gain experience with developing applications that use server communication.
Going forward from this course I feel I should be able to develop my own applications that use server communications for things such account management and online data tracking.
Such skills would be useful for pursuing a large number of software development positions.
